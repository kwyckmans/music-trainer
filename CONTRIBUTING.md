In its current state this project is very rough. I'm building this with the intent of only ever using it myself. On top of that, at the time of writing I have little to no experience with Svelte and front-end development in general.

If you want to use it yourself, or you see mee writing some silly code, you're welcome to add a PR to improve things, or correct things. I'll do my best to look at it, but this being a sideproject, it might take a while before I can do that.

And finally, if you're a dick, I won't even read what you write, I'll just close it and ignore it :).
